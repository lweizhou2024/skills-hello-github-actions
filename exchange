Coating Residual Stress

During the coating spray and heat treatment processes, residual stress inevitably develops in both the coating and substrate. The main contributing mechanisms include:

Initial temperature differences,

Phase transformations,

Crystallization,

Sintering,

Creep, and

Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) mismatch.

A fully detailed residual stress model is complex due to the multiphysics nature of the problem and the limited availability of material behavior data and process details. Therefore, a simplified approach is adopted here.

For a given coating material and heat treatment process, an eigenstrain value is assigned. This eigenstrain is calibrated by measuring the curvature change after each spray and heat-treatment step. The calibrated eigenstrain values are summarized in Table X for two different heat-treatment conditions.

Because residual stresses result from the mismatch between substrate and coating strain, the substrate is assumed to have zero eigenstrain, and only the coating layers require calibration.

Implementation in Finite Element Models

To incorporate eigenstrain into finite element simulations:

Each coating layer is assigned a unique stress-free (initial) temperature.

Stress-free temperatures are calculated using the coating’s CTE value and listed in Table Y.

The substrate is defined with zero eigenstrain, so its initial temperature is set to the reference temperature, 22 °C.

Coating Creep

At the service temperatures encountered in engines, coating materials undergo creep. This has two important effects:

Stress relaxation at high temperature, and

Accumulation of creep strain, which leads to tensile stresses during cooldown to lower temperatures.

Therefore, coating creep must be considered when modeling coating failure.

A strain-hardening creep model is used, which can capture both primary and secondary creep. Tertiary creep is excluded since creep rupture is not the focus.

Model Formulation

Both ANSYS and ABAQUS use equivalent formulations, which can be converted between one another at a given temperature:

ANSYS uses an Arrhenius-type temperature dependency.

During calibration, the ANSYS form is fitted and then converted into temperature-dependent parameters for use in ABAQUS.

Calibration was performed using four-point bending (flexure) tests, and the resulting parameters for different coatings and FE packages are provided in Table Z.

Implementation in ANSYS Workbench

Under Material Properties, add Strain Hardening Creep. Use reference units:
mm, s, K, tonne mm s⁻². Input parameters C1–C4.

In Analysis Settings, enable Creep Effects.

For program-controlled time stepping, set the Creep Limit Ratio between 1–10 (higher values allow larger time steps).

To prioritize speed with manual control, a very large number can be used.

Implementation in ABAQUS/CAE

Under Material Properties → Plasticity → Creep, add Strain Hardening creep.

Enable Temperature-Dependent Data.

Input model parameters.

In the Step Module, select Visco to activate creep.

Alternatively, creep parameters can be entered directly in the input deck.
